# Node.js Launcher Code Examples

### GitHub repo: [code-examples-node](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the DocuSign Admin API, Click API, eSignature REST API, Monitor API, and Rooms API. By default, the launcher will display the eSignature examples. To switch between API code examples, select "Choose API" in the top menu.


## Introduction

This repo is a Node.js application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth#required-scopes).  

For a list of code examples that use the eSignature API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Rooms API 

**Note:** To use the Rooms API, you must also [create your Rooms developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/create-account). Examples 4 and 6 require that you have the DocuSign Forms feature enabled in your Rooms for Real Estate account.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/) authentication.

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.

   For both authentication flows:

   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include redirect a URI of http://localhost:3000/ds/callback

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as

   {base_url}/ds/callback

   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.

1. [Node.js 8.10 or later with npm 5 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installation steps

**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 4 as it was automatically performed for you.
