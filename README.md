# Node.JS Launcher Code Examples

### Github repo: [code-examples-nodejs](./)
## Introduction
This repo is a Node.JS application that demonstrates:

1. **Embedded Signing Ceremony.**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg001EmbeddedSigning.js)
   This example sends an envelope, and then uses an embedded signing ceremony for the first signer.
   With embedded signing, the DocuSign signing ceremony is initiated from your website.
1. **Send an envelope with a remote (email) signer and cc recipient.**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg002SigningViaEmail.js)
   The envelope includes a pdf, Word, and HTML document.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **List envelopes in the user's account.**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg003ListEnvelopes.js)
1. **Get an envelope's basic information.**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg004EnvelopeInfo.js)
   The example lists the basic information about an envelope, including its overall status.
1. **List an envelope's recipients** 
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg005EnvelopeRecipients.js)
   Includes current recipient status.
1. **List an envelope's documents.**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg006EnvelopeDocs.js)

   are set to be read-only, others can be updated by the recipient. The example also stores
   metadata with the envelope.
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg016SetTabValues.js)
1. **Set template tab values.**
   The example creates an envelope using a template and sets the initial values for its tabs (fields).

   First, creates the envelope and then applies brand to it.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **Applying a brand to a template**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg030ApplyBrandToTemplate.js)
   This code example demonstrates how to apply a brand you've created to a template using using the [Create Envelope](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Envelopes/Envelopes/create) method. 
   You must have at least one created template and brand.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **Bulk sending envelopes to multiple recipients**
   [Source.](./lib/examples/eg031BulkSendEnvelopes.js)
   This code example demonstrates how to send envelopes in bulk to multiple recipients using these methods:
   [Create Bulk Send List](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/BulkEnvelopes/BulkSend/createBulkSendList), 
   [Create Bulk Send Request](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/BulkEnvelopes/BulkSend/createBulkSendRequest).
   Firstly, creates a bulk send recipients list, and then creates an envelope. 
   After that, initiates bulk envelope sending.



## Authentication types:

* Authentication with Docusign via [Authorization Code Grant flow](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-code-grant) .
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate.
The **refresh token** is not used in this example.

* Authentication with DocuSign via the [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-jsonwebtoken).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. A DocuSign Developer Sandbox account (email and password) on [demo.docusign.net](https://demo.docusign.net).
   Create a [free account](https://go.docusign.com/sandbox/productshot/?elqCampaignId=16534).

1. A DocuSign Integration Key (a client ID). To use Authorization code grant, you will need the **Integration Key** itself, and its **secret**. To use JSON Web token, you will need the **Integration Key** itself, the **RSA Secret Key** and an API user ID for the user you are impersonating.  

   If you use this example on your own workstation,
   the Integration key must include a **Redirect URI** of `http://localhost:5000/ds/callback`

   If you will not be running the example on your own workstation,
   use the appropriate DNS name and port instead of `localhost`

1. Node.JS v8.10 or later and NPM v5 or later.
1. A name and email for a signer, and a name and email for a cc recipient.
   The signer and the cc email cannot be the same.

### Installation steps
1. Download or clone this repository to your workstation to directory **code-examples-nodejs**
1. **cd code-examples-nodejs**
1. **npm install**
1. *Either:*

   * Update the file **config/appsettings.json** in the project's root directory
     with the Integration Key
     and other settings, *or*
   * Create and export environment variables for the settings.
     See the **config/appsettings.json** file
     for the names of the environment variables.

   **Note:** Protect your Integration Key and secret--If you update
   the config/appsettings.json file, then you
   should ensure that it will not be stored in your source code
   repository.

1. **npm start**
1. Open a browser to **http://localhost:5000**

### Configuring JWT

1. Create a developer sandbox account on developers.docusign.com if you don't already have one.
2. Create a new API key in the Admin panel: https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key, take note of the public key.
3. Set a redirect URI of `http://localhost:5000/ds/callback` as mentioned in the installation steps above for the API key you make in step 2.
4. Generate an RSA keypair in the administrator console on the DocuSign developer sandbox and copy the private key to a secure location.
5. Create a new file in your repo source folder named **private.key**, and paste in that copied RSA private key, then save it.
6. Update the file **config/appsettings.json** and include the newly created API key from step 2 as well as your account user id GUID which is also found on the Admin panel: `https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key`.

From there you should be able to run the launcher using **npm start** then selecting **JSON Web Token** when authenticaing your account.


#### Payments code example
To use the payments example, create a 
test payments gateway for your developer sandbox account. 

See the 
[PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](./code-examples-node/blob/master/PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md)
file for instructions.
   
Then add the payment gateway account id to the **config/appsettings.json** file.

## Using the examples with other authentication flows

The examples in this repository can also be used with either the
Implicit Grant or JWT OAuth flows.
See the [Authentication guide](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication)
for information on choosing the right authentication flow for your application.
